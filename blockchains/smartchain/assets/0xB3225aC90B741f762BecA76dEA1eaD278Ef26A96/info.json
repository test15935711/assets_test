    "description": "At Lonely Fans we were sick and tired of seeing BS coins launch everyday, almost none of them having real value for its’ holders. We decided to change that, launching a token which gives back to its’ holders, providing them access to top OnlyFans content creators. Do we even need to mention that this coin will pay for your retirement? Didn’t think so.",
